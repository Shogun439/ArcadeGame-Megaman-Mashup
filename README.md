# Frogger & Megaman Mashup

This is a Udacity Frontend Nanodegree project.

Welcome to my Repo. Since my childhood I was and still am a die hard Megaman fan,
I thought I would add some custom Sprites and Soundfiles to make this game feel more like Megaman.
I really enjoyed the process and learned so much, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

## Usage:
