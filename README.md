# Frogger & Megaman Mashup

This is a Udacity Frontend Nanodegree project.

Welcome to my Repo. Since my childhood I was and still am a die hard Megaman fan,
I thought I would add some custom Sprites and Soundfiles to make this game feel more like Megaman.
I really enjoyed the process and learned so much, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

## Usage:

You choose between  
![#1589F0](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) `Megaman` ![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) `Protoman` ![#424141](https://placehold.it/15/424141/000000?text=+) `Bass`
and your goal is to try to get to the river. 
Dont get caught by the enemies or else its game over.
You navigate with the Arrow keys on your Keyboard.

Sprites downloaded on http://supermariobroscrossover.com/media/

Soundfiles found on https://www.sounds-resource.com/nes/megaman/sound/7955/

##### Possible improvements:
If I get to have time again, I will add new and more challenging levels and enemies. 
Sometimes the background music starts with a delay, I have to find out what the cause is. A possible cause would be performance issues.
